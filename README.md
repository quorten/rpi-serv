========

This is the configuration scripts that I use to configure my Raspberry
Pi B+ home server.  Previously I was running on an old laptop but have
since migrated to a Raspberry Pi, which is nicer because it is much
lower power... and the laptop itself was an experiment to determine if
I need to go bigger, or if I can go smaller.  As fate turned out, the
home server wasn't very popular among other family folks sharing the
same local area network, so I decided to go smaller with the Raspberry
Pi.
