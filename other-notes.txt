NOT included/installed: Samba, though this was on the old server.  Not
really ever used.

Important!  When cutting over to new server hardware, copy the logs
from the old server to the new server for reference.  (Well, at least
the logs you care about.)  Don't worry about copying over the SSH
keys.  In fact, you shouldn't do this as SSH keys should generally
correspond to machines, not host names.  Of course, ultimately it's
your choice.
